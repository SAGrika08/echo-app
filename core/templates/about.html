<h1>About Echo</h1>
<hr />
<p class="page-content">
  Echo is a personal ambient sound mixer. Record sounds from your microphone, upload audio files, or link sounds from the web, then layer them together, balance the volumes, and save your mix as a scene. Come back to it any time.
</p>
<p class="page-content">
  The right atmosphere changes everything. The way rain against a window makes writing easier. The way a fireplace makes 2am feel safe. Echo is built around that idea, that sound is not background noise, it is the shape of a moment. Your moments deserve to be designed.
</p>
<h2>How it works</h2>
